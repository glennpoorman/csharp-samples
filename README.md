# C# Samples

These samples are setup to guide C++ programmers into C# beginning with the classic "Hello World!" and then introducing additional concepts one at a time.

## Requirements

You should have (minimum) Visual Studio 2019 installed on your system.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that the reader has some experience with programming languages and, more specifically, experience with C++. Several concepts that are already present in a language like C++ won't be explained here and you need to be familiar with them. Some of those concepts are (but are not limited to):

1. Class types (*class* and *struct*)
2. Class vs instance members (*static*)
3. Basic access (*public*, *private*, *protected*)

## How to proceed

All of the details are in the code. Go through the numbered samples one at a time opening the solution file in Visual Studio and reading the comments thoroughly.
